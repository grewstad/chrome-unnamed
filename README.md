Hi there!
--INTRO--
No, i don't tell people i use arch btw. But i get the people who do, because that is one hell of a feat. This project aims to install an opinionated arch + hyprland setup on your system with the simplicity of Ubuntu or Endeavour. It aims to let you use the lightweight and powerful nature of arch while skipping the long setup. Because arch causes people's brains to explode. If your brain is prone to exploding, you may like this project. I am a student with not much time on my hands, and would appreciate contribution.
